description: 'In the 2022 AzureCup competition, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annasurovkova/" target="_blank" class="anchor-modal">Anna Surovkova</a> and I decided to tackle the problem of inadequate awareness among people about proper sorting of organic waste under the project named Rotty. The project consists of several parts. Our output was an application that directly connects a user to a local waste company to order a organic waste collection. My job was to integrate Microsoft technologies like Power Apps and Microsoft Azure to build a working solution. <strong>We managed to win the competition!</strong>'
